<h2 class="abouthead">To Do List</h2>


<p class="about">To-Do List.These are prioritized lists of all the tasks that you need to carry out. 
    They list everything that you have to do, with the most important 
    tasks at the top of the list, and the least important tasks at the bottom.
    By keeping such a list, you make sure that your tasks are written down all 
    in one place so you don't forget anything important. And by prioritizing tasks,
    you plan the order in which you'll do them, so that you can tell what needs your
    immediate attention, and what you can leave until later.</p>
